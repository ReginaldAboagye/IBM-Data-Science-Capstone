# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone

## Background
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of $62 million, while other providers cost upward of $165 million each. Much of the Falcon 9's savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can accurately predict the likelihood of a rocket landing's first stage successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch. 

In this project, I will predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully and help competitors make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
