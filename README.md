# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone

### Background
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of $62 million; other providers cost upward of $165 million each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch. 

In this project, I will predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully and help competitors make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch. Below, you can view the results of my findings from each step of the project so far.
