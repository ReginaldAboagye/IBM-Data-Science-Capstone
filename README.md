# SpaceX Rocket Landing Predictive Analysis
## Background
SpaceX is a leading designer and manufacturer of advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of $62 million, while other providers cost upwards of $165 million each. Much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage of the launch. However, sometimes the first stage does not land and cannot be recovered. Therefore, if we can determine whether the first stage will land successfully, we can more accurately predict the costÂ of a launch.

In this project, I'll collect and process raw data from a variety of sources, explore the data using different visual analytics tools, and build a predictive model to determine whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully to help competitors make more informed bids.

- Collected launch data using the SpaceX REST API.
- Scraped additional data from related websites and wikis using Python's `BeautifulSoup` package.

### [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/kellibelcher/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Lab%202:%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)
- Preprocessed and cleaned the data set to begin data exploration.

### [Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL](https://github.com/kellibelcher/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Lab%203:%20SQL%20EDA.ipynb)
- Utilized Python's SQL extension to connect Jupyter notebook to IBM's DB2 cloud database.
- Wrote SQL queries to explore, summarize, and gain insights from the data.

### [Data Visualization EDA](https://github.com/kellibelcher/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Lab%204:%20EDA%20Data%20viz.ipynb)
- Explored the relationships between different features in the data set using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` graphs.

### [Geospatial Analysis using Folium](https://github.com/kellibelcher/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Lab%205:%20Mapping%20launch%20site%20locations.ipynb)
- Created interactive leaflet maps using `folium` and analyzed existing launch site locations to identify geographical trends in the data.

### [Launch Site Success Rate Plotly Dash App](http://spacexdashappkellibelcher.pythonanywhere.com/)
- Developed an interactive Plotly Dash app to analyze success rates based on launch site location and payload weight.
