In this project, I will predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of my Data Science findings and models, competitors will be able to make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

In this repository, you can view the results of my work as I follow each phase of the Data Science lifecycle, including data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting my results to peers and stakeholders.
