# SpaceX Rocket Landing Predictive Analysis
## Background
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of $62 million, while other providers cost upwards of $165 million each. Much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage of the launch. However, sometimes the first stage does not land and cannot be recovered. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land successfully, we can more accurately predict the costÂ of a launch and make more informed bids.

In this project, I'll collect and process raw data from a variety of sources, explore the data using different visual analytics tools, and build a predictive model to determine whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.

- Collected SpaceX data using a Rest API.
- Scraped additional rocket launch data from the web using Python's `BeautifulSoup` package.

### [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/kellibelcher/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Lab%202:%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)
- Preprocessed and cleaned the data set to begin data exploration.

### [Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL](https://github.com/kellibelcher/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Lab%203:%20SQL%20EDA.ipynb)
- Utilized Python's SQL extension to connect Jupyter notebook to IBM's DB2 cloud database.
- Wrote SQL queries to explore, summarize, and gain insights from the data.

### [Data Visualization EDA](https://github.com/kellibelcher/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Lab%204:%20EDA%20Data%20viz.ipynb)
- Explored the relationships between different features in the data set using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` graphs.

### [Geospatial Analysis using Folium](https://github.com/kellibelcher/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Lab%205:%20Mapping%20launch%20site%20locations.ipynb)
- Analyzed existing launch site locations and created interactive leaflet maps using `folium`.
